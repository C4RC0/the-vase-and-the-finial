## Code art

There are countless types of computer-generated artworks.
The generative art when an object repeats, and one or more parameters are
constantly changing. One such branch of art is the fractal.

The code art is a branch of digital art which instead of to show repetitions, all item
is unique as a brushstroke.

In programming, object inheritance is often used, especially
In object-oriented programming. Functional conventions, on the other hand, require it
that the result should always be a new object and not the modified version of the old object. What is the most basic object? A point, a line,
a circle or a square, possibly a number, or a string... it is a far-reaching philosophical question.

In code art, the expectation is that the items are completely independent of each other
so inheritance of the objects should be used as little as possible.

Obviously, this also depends on the specifics of the language used. Eg some the pure css
artworks there are approaches fit into the code art category. 
They do not strive to creating generations or visualize the program code objects in a generalized way, 
but use the code as a tool for creating a full-fledged graphics.

Overall, code art contrasts itself with generative art
and uses the code as a tool. There are no programmed processes in it
which would generate the creation of items. Each item exists on its own,
independent of the other items, and its creation is the task of the artist.

This is not to say only descriptive languages usable for it, scripting languages 
usable too respecting the conventions of the branch of art
