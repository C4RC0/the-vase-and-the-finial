#The vase and the finial
### A conceptual, new-media-art website for 'The vase and the finial' painting

## The concept

In logical order, an artist creates a work in such a way that first
make sketches and learn about the subject, then create the artwork.
Now my concept was to reverse this process:

- the oil painting was made first (2012)
- then the computer-edited 2D version was  made (2021)

During the process the artwork to become more perfect, more realistic.
I was wondering how changes the end result,
and what is changing in the creator.

When I get to the end of the process I learned it perfectly
where is the correct shadow and what is the exact shape. But it can't
impress the original artwork because it was completed 9 years ago.

The 2 images and this website where I present them together,
is an interactive realization of a conceptual idea 
what presenting the creating process.

Separately examined the painting is a realistic still life.

## The original

In 2012, I painted this still life on 40x50 canvas with oil.
My teacher was Csaba Flip. He is a Munkacsy award-winning painter and teacher.
I created this painting in his studio.

In the composition show a vase and a finial next to each other.
The black vase is from my mother, and the roof decoration is made of copper by my carpenter father.

## Why pure-css?

I made version 2D with pure-css. There is only one reason for this:
I am a developer, and it was a challenge for me. In Illustrator,
I could have done it much faster, but it’s just would have been a sketch .... In this form, it is also valid as an independent artwork
within the code-art genre.

Some people use a program that converts an image to css, but that's not the real solution, 
it's just a game, or a joke: "look how skillful I am?"All this program does is convert the image pixel by pixel. 
Real pure-css creations consist of shapes like vector graphics and not pixels.

## Code art

There are countless types of computer-generated artworks.
The generative art when an object repeats, and one or more parameters are
constantly changing. One such branch of art is the fractal.

The code art is a branch of digital art which instead of to show repetitions, all item
is unique as a brushstroke.

In programming, object inheritance is often used, especially
In object-oriented programming. Functional conventions, on the other hand, require it
that the result should always be a new object and not the modified version of the old object. What is the most basic object? A point, a line,
a circle or a square, possibly a number, or a string... it is a far-reaching philosophical question.

In code art, the expectation is that the items are completely independent of each other
so inheritance of the objects should be used as little as possible.

Obviously, this also depends on the specifics of the language used. Eg some the pure css
artworks there are approaches fit into the code art category. 
They do not strive to creating generations or visualize the program code objects in a generalized way, 
but use the code as a tool for creating a full-fledged graphics.

Overall, code art contrasts itself with generative art
and uses the code as a tool. There are no programmed processes in it
which would generate the creation of items. Each item exists on its own,
independent of the other items, and its creation is the task of the artist.

This is not to say only descriptive languages usable for it, scripting languages 
usable too respecting the conventions of the branch of art.
