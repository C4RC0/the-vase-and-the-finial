# The vase and the finial
### A conceptual, new-media-art website for 'The vase and the finial' painting

## The concept

In logical order, an artist creates a work in such a way that first makes sketches and learns about the subject, then creates the artwork. Now my concept was to reverse this process:

 - the oil painting was made first (2012)
 - then the computer-edited 2D version was made (2021)

During the process, the artwork became more perfect, more realistic. I was wondering how the result was changing and what was changing in the creator.

When I got to the end of the process I learned perfectly where the correct shadow was and what the exact shape was. But it could not have an effect on the original artwork because that was completed 9 years ago.

The two images and this website where I present them together, is an interactive realization of a conceptual idea that presents the creating process. 

Separately examined, the painting is a realistic still life.

## The original

In 2012, I painted this still life on a 40x50 canvas with oil. My teacher was Csaba Flip. He is a Munkácsy award-winning painter and teacher. I created this painting in his studio.

The composition shows a vase and a finial next to each other. The black vase belongs to my mother, and the roof decoration is made of copper by my carpenter father.

## Why pure-css?

I made version 2D with pure-css. There is only one reason for this. I am a developer, and it was a challenge for me. In Illustrator, I could have completed it much faster, but it just would have been a sketch. In this form, it is also valid as an independent artwork within the code-art genre.

Some people use a program that converts an image to css, but that is not the real solution; it is just a game or a joke: "Look, how skillful I am". All this program does is convert the image pixel by pixel. Real pure-css creations consist of shapes like vector graphics and not pixels.

## Code art

There are countless types of computer-generated artworks. Generative art is when an object repeats, and one or more parameters are constantly changing. One such branch of art is the fractal.

Code art is a branch of digital art in which, instead of showing repetitions, all items are unique as a brushstroke.

In programming, object inheritance is often used, especially in object-oriented programming. Functional conventions, on the other hand, require that the result should always be a new object and not the modified version of the old object. What is the most basic object? A point, a line, a circle or a square; possibly a number, or a string... it is a far-reaching philosophical question.

In code art, the expectation is that the items are completely independent of each other, so the inheritance of the objects should be used as little as possible.

Obviously, this also depends on the specifics of the language being used. E.g., some of the pure css artworks fit into the code art category. They do not strive to create generations or visualize the program code objects in a generalized way but use the code as a tool for creating  full-fledged graphics.

Overall, code art contrasts itself with generative art and uses the code as a tool. There are no programmed processes in it which would generate the creation of items. Each item exists on its own, independent of the other items, and its creation is the task of the artist. This does not mean that only descriptive languages can be used for it, scripting languages are usable too, respecting the conventions of code art.
